There are three types of design patterns.
Creational:
This type deals with object creation and initialization. This pattern gives the program mre flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for
a given case.
ex: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory

Structural:
This type deals with class and object composition.
This pattern focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes and its objects
ex: adaptor, bridge

Behavioural:

this type deals with communication between classes and objects.

Features of Singleton Pattern:
- Ensure that only one instance of class exists.
- Provide global instance of that instance by
  . declaring all constructors of the class to be private
  . providing static method that returns a reference to the instance
  . the instance is stored as private static variable
